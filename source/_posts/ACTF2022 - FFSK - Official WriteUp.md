~~众所周知歪歪歪英文很烂求轻喷~~  

## 0. Intro

In the game period, only one team had solved this problem: MapleBacon, a genius team at the University of British Columbia. I’m happy about their praise, but after checking their solution I think what truly “impressive” is their creativity and persistence.

**Strongly recommend reading their awesome solution: [https://maplebacon.org/2022/06/actf-ffsk/](https://maplebacon.org/2022/06/actf-ffsk/)**

FSK = Frequency-shift keying.

FFSK = Double FSK or Fast FSK, whatever.

This problem is designed to invite participants to have a look at *the principle of communication*.

## 1. Description

A journey to solve a misc problem always begins from a problem description. Here’s it:

> I’ve bought the **second commercial modem** for computers in a big city of the UK.
>
>
> > 激情澎湃的球迷迷恋这个地方。遇上球赛季，酒吧里的热情、呐喊、啤酒、摇滚，足球让这个城市充满活力和希望。
> 从三万英尺的云端望去，往日的生活成了一个遥远微小的地图。
> 阳光明媚的日子，开始出发，北京时间00:50 开始起飞，一个梦的距离，就可以到达荷兰阿姆斯特丹，短暂停留之后，然后转机飞往英国
> 南航的飞机配置完备，全程可以充电，还有wifi，影视屏有面前最新的电影。睡睡醒醒，在飞机上觅到一部《北京爱情故事》，让我在三万英尺的空中哭的稀里哗啦。
>

Just Google it, and you’ll realize what it means:

- **second commercial modem→Bell 103, corresponds with the file name “modem.wav”**
- a big city in the UK: **Manchester**, which refers to the famous coding method.
- The source of the long Chinese paragraph: [https://kknews.cc/zh-hk/travel/e6yjp34.html](https://kknews.cc/zh-hk/travel/e6yjp34.html)

    It describes a trip to Manchester, which is indeed a big city in the UK.

## 2. Bell 103

Here’s an article that shows how the Bell 103 protocol works: [https://vigrey.com/blog/emulating-bell-103-modem](https://vigrey.com/blog/emulating-bell-103-modem)

So two key points need your attention. First, characters are stored in ASCII code and are **little-endian;** second, it has 2 channels for communication: one for the server-side(2025/2225 Hz), and another for the client-side(1070/1270 Hz).

You can also find it from the spectrogram of the .wav file.

## 3. Server channel

Using the `minimodem`tool (See MapleBacon’s write-up) is functional.

Also, you can find some useful tools in GitHub: [https://github.com/laurenschneider/audiodecoder](https://github.com/laurenschneider/audiodecoder)

It may be a faster way. In fact, the `solve.py` is based on its code.

After all, you’ll see this on the server channel:

```plaintext
HINT_Hamming@ddddPdddddddPdddPdPP(20).ECCode; Content: Why do you use such
a slow method with a high Bit Error Ratio for communication? It took me a lot of
effort to correct bit-flips, making sure the communication was less
error-prone...that is 2 say, THE ORIGINAL PROTOCOL IS WRAPPED BY SOME OTHER
TRANSFORMATIONS! Fortunately, we can now communicate properly on another channel
while enjoying a vacation in this BIG CITY--I mean, IEEE 802.3.....Wait, what is
the new protocol? Guess by yourself!
```

## 4. Client channel

We can extract the bit string on this channel using the same method but just make some tweaks of frequency. You’ll get a bit string of 53640 bits.

Notice that the bit string contains only “01” “10”, that is what **Manchester is** all about. The `IEEE 802.3`mentioned in the server channel message is actually to make sure you decode in the right way: there are 2 opposite ways to map 01/10 to 1/0, but what is widely used is defined in IEEE 802.3, which says “01”→1 and “10”→0

Then the key problem is to solve Hamming code. From the given information, you’ll realize the block size is 20bits. Implement it by yourself or just Google/GitHub/StackOverflow it.

Find every “1” bit in a block, XOR their **positions**, and magically you got the error bit position(0 if no error) which is a well-designed feature of Hamming code, then just flip the bit.

Actually, every block has, and only has an error bit: that’s an intended design to notify you that you’re on the right way :)

## 5. Final Step

Now you’ve got the cipher bit string: just applied Bell 103 decoder to it once again.

It’ll yield a string that starts with `data:image/png;base64,`

An experienced CTFer will immediately put it into the browser (like what MapleBacon did). Or you can find a random online converter to recover this Base64-encoded image. It’s a QR Code. Scan it, and got the flag.

## 6. Hints Explanation

1. `所有人都认为，吃鸡蛋前，原始的方法是打破鸡蛋较大的一端。可是当今皇帝的祖父 时候吃鸡蛋，一次按古法打鸡蛋时碰巧将一个手指弄破了，因此他的父亲，当时的皇帝， 就下了一道敕令，命令全体臣民吃鸡蛋时打破鸡蛋较小的一端，违令者重罚。 老百姓们 对这项命令极为反感。历史告诉我们，由此曾发生过六次叛乱，其中一个皇帝送了命，另 一个丢了王位…关于这一争端，曾出版过几百本大部著作，不过大端派的书一直是受禁的 ，法律也规定该派的任何人不得做官。 ——乔纳森·斯威夫特，《格列佛游记》`

    It is a quote from Gulliver's Travels.  Fun fact: this paragraph is **exactly the original source of the 2 words used in modern computer science: “big-endian” & “little-endian”.**

    This hint is intended to guide those who are stuck because of their ignorance of the contents(especially the coding method) of the Bell 103 protocol.

2. `Hamming code block size: 20bits`

    Noticed that minimodem may yield partly corrupt text and mislead participants. This hint is to make sure they see the hint hidden at the beginning of the service-side channel message.

3. `Bell 103`

    For those who ignored the problem description.

### 7. Final Words

In my eyes, a good misc problem should not be an annoying puzzle. Steps to solve a misc problem have to be reasonable. For example, in this problem, Manchester coding is applied after the application of Hamming coding: that’s because the former is channel coding, and the latter is source coding. We shouldn’t just pick some random encryption and apply it to plaintext.

 I have made my best to make the solving process more natural. I hope you enjoy digging deep into the problem. You’ll earn much more fun than those who can just use tools written by others without understanding fundamental principles (like me).

ご武運を！
