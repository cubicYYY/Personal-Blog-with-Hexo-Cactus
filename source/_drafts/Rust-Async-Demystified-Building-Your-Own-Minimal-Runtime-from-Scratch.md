## Intro

### Target of This Article
Not only applies to Rust programming.

### What is Async Programming

### Concurrency is NOT necessarily Parallelism: 

### Why NOT to Use Callbacks?

---

## Async Programming in Rust is Stackless and Lazy

### Comparing with Async Programming in Other Languages

### `Future`: Basically a State Machine

### `async` and `await`: Syntax Sugar, that's it!

### Rust-ish Topic: `Pin<>`, `Unpin`, and `Send + Sync`

## Implement Your Own Async Runtime in Rust!

### Reactor and Executor
